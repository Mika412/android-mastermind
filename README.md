Mastermind for Android
==========

Mastermind game for android, where the computer will try to guess your chosen colour combination.

A possible guess combination of colours will be displayed on the screen and you choose your answer for each colour, where black means one of the coloyrs is in the correct place, white, when there is a correct colour but in the wrong place and red when the colour is incorrect.

##### Bug:

If you change your combination midgame and your combination is not one of the possibilities from the previous combination, the app will crash.
